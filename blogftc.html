                <br><b>How It All Began</b>
                <br>
                I first came across the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) through YouTube highlights, and it immediately caught
                my interest. The idea of designing and competing with robots in a global competition fascinated me, and
                I knew I had to try it. One day, I found out that LegoGoa Axi0m (#22588), a rookie team, was recruiting
                members. I wasn’t sure if I’d be selected, but I applied anyway. Our team was officially formed, and our
                first meeting was held on November 13, 2022. We were participating for the first time, and the goal was
                simple: contribute as much as possible, learn from each other, and grow both technically and personally.

                <b>Understanding the FTC 2022-23 POWERPLAY Challenge</b>
                <br>
                The POWERPLAY season, presented by Raytheon Technologies, was an intense and dynamic challenge that
                pushed teams to their limits. It revolved around strategy, precision, and efficiency, requiring not just
                technical skills but also quick thinking and adaptability in high-pressure situations. The objective was
                to design a robot that could navigate a field and place cones on junctions of different heights. The
                game had three main segments:
                <br><br>
                ➡️Autonomous Period – Robots operated independently for 30 seconds using pre-programmed instructions.
                <br><br>
                ➡️Driver-Controlled Period – Drivers controlled the robots for 2 minutes to score points.
                <br><br>
                ➡️Endgame – The last 30 seconds where teams could score additional points through special tasks.
                <br><br>
                Scoring required teams to stack cones on poles, create links between junctions, and use strategic
                planning to control zones. This made the game not just about building a great robot but also about
                teamwork, coding, and real-time decision-making.

                <b>Challenges We Faced</b>
                <br>
                As a rookie team stepping into the grand arena of FTC, we knew the road ahead would be anything but
                easy. The journey was filled with hurdles that tested our resilience and creativity at every step. One
                of the biggest was procuring parts. Import taxes on FTC kits were high, making it difficult to order
                components. Thankfully, our mentor connected with individuals traveling to India, who helped bring in
                the necessary kits, reducing our costs. Additionally, every team member had to contribute financially,
                and we worked hard to secure sponsorships.

                <b>My Role in the Team</b>
                <br>

                I took on multiple responsibilities:
                <br><br>
                ➡️<i>Co-Head of Robot Building</i> – Led the mechanical design and construction.
                <br><br>

                <b>Team Dynamics: The Fun & The Challenges</b>
                <br>
                Our team had members from different age groups, schools, and educational boards, which led to occasional
                communication gaps and conflicts. However, these struggles were expected in a diverse group, and we
                learned to adapt. Despite the challenges, we had many fun team activities, including bonding sessions,
                brainstorming events, and technical workshops. I really enjoyed my time with my teammates, especially
                Venkatesh Dempo, with whom I had a great bond—we were together throughout the journey, and it was a good
                time. I also built close friendships with Taksh, Dhruv, Shounak, Parth, Aryan, Samihan, Vighnesh, Viraj,
                Sai Pranav and many
                others, making this experience even more special.
                <br><br>
                Our coach had incredibly high expectations, treating every practice session like a real competition. He
                pushed me beyond my limits, sometimes with tough criticism, but also with well-earned words of
                encouragement. Every mistake was a lesson, and every success was a stepping stone to becoming better.
                His guidance played a major role in our progress.

                We also received support from Team Sigma (#20890), an experienced FTC team from RoboFunLab Mumbai &
                Ahmedabad. They conducted free online workshops for us, visited in person to guide us, and helped refine
                our robot design. We truly enjoyed engaging with them, learning from their experiences, and discussing
                ideas. In return, we organized an event to honor their support and contributions.

                <b>The Final Push: Last Month Before the Championship</b>
                <br>
                As the championship approached, life became incredibly hectic. Since I was co-head of the build team and
                head of documentation, my responsibilities piled up. At the same time, my school tests and competitions
                were ongoing, making time management a nightmare. I prioritized FTC, often working until midnight to
                finalize designs and build strategies.

                <br><br>

                At times, I was not treated well, but I understood the pressure on our coach and team. This was all part
                of the game.

                <br>

                And then, the moment we had all been waiting for arrived—the FTC India Championship, held from March
                10-12, 2023, at Balewadi Stadium, Pune. The air buzzed with excitement, and the sheer energy in the
                venue was electrifying. It felt like stepping into a battlefield where months of hard work would be put
                to the ultimate test. The moment we stepped into the venue, the atmosphere was electric. Teams from
                Asia, Europe, and America were present, making the competition truly global.
                <br><br>

                Day 1: The atmosphere inside the stadium was electrifying. Teams from across India and around the world
                had gathered, each showcasing months of hard work. The first day was all about robot inspections,
                setting up our pit area, and last-minute tweaks. Our robot needed some modifications to meet competition
                standards, so we worked on adjustments while also exploring the event. My fellow teammates spent time
                scouting info about the other teams, understanding their strengths, and forming potential alliances and
                strategies for the league matches and play-offs.

                Day 2: This was when the real action began. Our first two matches were nerve-wracking, but all the
                effort paid off—we won both! The competition was intense, but we stayed focused, ensuring our robot
                performed at its best. Between matches, I was stationed at the pitstop, making sure the robot was
                serviced and ready for the next round. We also had our jury session, where we presented our outreach
                efforts and technical documentation to the judges. The day ended on a high note, and excitement for the
                next round was at its peak.

                stadium was contagious—teams cheering, strategizing, and pushing their robots to the limit. We secured
                8th place in our division (Raman Division), an incredible feat for a rookie team. In the playoffs, Team
                Sigma selected us as their alliance partner, and together, we fought our way to the semifinals. The
                final moments were intense, and although we didn’t reach the finals, our hard work was recognized with
                the Motivational Award—a proud moment for all of us.

                    <br><br>
                    👉Placed 8th in our division (Raman Division). Being a rookee team and we being in the top 10 was a

                <b>Personal Growth & Takeaways</b>
                <br>
                This journey shaped me in ways I never expected:
                <br>

                <i>
                    👉Learned to handle pressure and accept mistakes maturely.
                    <br><br>
                    👉Gained technical knowledge that made physics concepts tangible.
                    <br><br>
                    👉Built strong industry connections and friendships.
                    <br><br>
                    👉Understood the value of hard work and sacrifice.
                    <br><br>
                    👉Grew into a more educated, confident, and experienced individual.</i>
                <br><br>
                Now, as I turn 18 next year, I realize I can no longer compete in FTC. But the lessons learned will stay
                with me for life.

                <b>Advice for Future FTC Participants</b>
                <br><br>
                <i>
                    ➡️Listen to your coaches – They know what’s best.
                    <br><br>
                    ➡️Work hard and never give up – Challenges make the journey worthwhile.
                    <br><br>
                    ➡️Be smart with your resources – Innovation isn’t just about spending money; hacks (jugaads) work!
                </i>
                <br><br>
                Looking back, this journey was nothing short of a rollercoaster—filled with exhilarating highs, crushing
                lows, and moments of pure adrenaline. The thrill of competition, the long nights of preparation, and the
                friendships forged along the way made every second worth it. Now, I finally understand why students call
                FTC “the hardest fun you’ll ever have in high school.” The words hold so much meaning now!
